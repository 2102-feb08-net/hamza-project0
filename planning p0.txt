in the console when the program is first ran:
	ask if they want to search a Customer or Location (and input userid or location name) or if they want to place an order
	if they want to search:
		for Customer, display all info (except order history which will be asked if they wanna see it)
		for Location, display all info including inventory (except order history ^^^)
	for placing orders:
		ask for userid or if they want to create a new Customer
		if they want to create new customer:
			ask userid (check valid), first and last name
		ask for location then list the inventory
		ask what they would like to add and quantity
		list their cart and ask if they are done (if not, repeat from the last step).
		once done, place the order
	after placing order, return to the first step








Notes:
later can have default location for customer
check all user inputs
have a way to go back in the menu
all data must persist (probably in a file)
